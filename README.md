#### Features

- Written from the ground up for use with old-school, 2D games. 
MonODGE.UI was developed with classic turn-based RPGs in mind, but can be used for any genre.
- Keyboard and GamePad-based input. (MonODGE.UI intentionally does not have mouse support.) 
- CSS-like Stylesheet based visuals.
Customize your game's look and feel to fit your style, and even change it on the fly!
- Event-driven functionality.
